# 🍽️ BuenProvecho

Welcome to BuenProvecho, a FullStack web application developed for the sustainability track at HackAI DMF 2024. Our project leverages cutting-edge AI technology from OpenAI's GPT-4 vision to promote sustainability and reduce food waste by helping you manage your pantry more efficiently.

## 🚀 Project Overview

BuenProvecho is designed to make your kitchen smarter. By scanning the food items you purchase or those you already have at home, our app uses GPT-4 vision to identify the exact list of ingredients, their quantities, classifications (fruits, vegetables, beverages, etc.), and estimated expiration dates. All this information is stored in a local database, where you can easily view and manage your food inventory.

### 🌟 Features

- **👨‍🍳 Chefsito - Your AI Kitchen Assistant**: Based on the items you have, Chefsito provides personalized cooking recipes, prioritizing ingredients that are about to expire to help you reduce food waste.
- **📊 Local Database**: All scanned items are saved in a local database, allowing you to track and manage your pantry inventory effectively.
- **💻 Responsive Design**: Built with React, Next.js 14, and Tailwind CSS for a seamless and responsive user experience.

The app keeps track of all recorded items during the session.
